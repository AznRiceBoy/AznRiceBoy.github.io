                The Different Forms of Ice
            </h1>
            <h2>
            <p>
The dictionary definition of Ice is “frozen water, a brittle, transparent crystalline solid”.This, however, is not always the case. I have explored the world for approximately 18 years and have gathered an extensive amount of information on the subject of “Ice”. This webpage is my way of sharing my knowledge on the different types of Ice one can find while exploring the world.
	</p>

<p>
 I believe Ice could be split into 3 different categories:
</p>
<ol type="1">
  <li>The solid form of water. A.K.A. “Cold Bois”</li>
  <li>The form of Jewelry, commonly referring to gold objects surrounded by diamonds.</li>
  <li>The accessory called watches. This is my personal favorite form of ice. Some people know this form of ice to be called “Heat”.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Examples of each form of “Ice” is shown below with some images. Click on the images to see images of those ices.
